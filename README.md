# VBA_scripting
In this activity my VBA script completes folowing tasks:
- loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year
- calculate yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was
- calculate the percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed
- calculate total Volume of the stock and display ticker symbol
- implement conditional formating  that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red
- locates and displays the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume"
